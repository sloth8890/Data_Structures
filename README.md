# Data Structures Implementation

## Introduction 
This repository is implementation of various data structures for those who needs to revise the concepts in a short time. I created this repository for preparing the coding interview.

## Contents
Test commands displayed to the corresponding link. So you may fork this repository and modify the ```Main.java``` for testing your own curiosity.

## Algorithms

## Time Complexity 
The time complexity is the amount of time an algorithm takes to **complete** with the size of input. It measures the number of basic operations or steps from the implementation. 
The time complexity helps analyse how the algorithm's runtime grows as the input size increases. 

## Space Complexity 

The space complexity is the measurement of total space required by an **algorithm** to execute. It measures the total storage space required by the algorithm, including both the input data and any additional **auxiliary** space used during execution.
