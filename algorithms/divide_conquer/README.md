# Divide and Conquer

Divide and Conquer has three major stages to solve.
1. Divide : Break up problem into several parts
2. Delegate : Solve each part recursively
3. Combine : solutions to sub-problems into overall solution. This also requires accounting for interaction between subproblem.
A common usage is 
- Break up problem of size n into **two** equal parts of size *n/2*
- Solve two parts recursively
- Combine two solutions into overall solution in **linear time**
