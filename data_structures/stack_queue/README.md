# Stack & Queue

## Introduction

This repository covers the stack and queue operations and theory. 


## Stack

A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. 
This represents the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it as a stack of items where you can only add or remove the items from the top. 

### Operations 

- Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
- Peek: Retrieves the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
- isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
- Size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Queue

A queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. 
In a queue, the first element added is the first one to be removed, similar to waiting in a line (queue) where the person who arrives first is the first to leave. 

### Operations

- Enqueue: Adds an element to the back (end) of the queue.
- Dequeue: Removes the element from the front (head) of the queue.
- Peek: Retrieves the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
- isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.
- Size: Returns the number of elements in the queue.

## Conclusion

Common use cases for stacks include managing function calls in a programming language (the call stack), parsing expressions, undo mechanisms in software, and solving problems recursively. Where queues are commonly used in scenarios where tasks need to be executed in the order they are received, such as print job management, task scheduling, and breadth-first search algorithms.
