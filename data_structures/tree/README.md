# Tree

## Introduction

Tree is the data structure that is a non-linear. The single node can be connected to the multiple nodes. It has hierarchical structure for various application like data storage, search and sort algorithms. 

You are required to know these terms used in the Tree structure.
```
Node : a single data storage
Root : where tree start
Children : it is a node of a parent node 
Parent : upper node of child node
Siblings : same parents
Ancestor : going up from a child or leaf
Descendant : going down from top, root
Leaf : node that does not have any child node
```
## Types 

### Binary Tree

### Full Binary Tree

### Complete Full Binary Tree

### Binary Search Tree
